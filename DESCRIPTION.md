## Description

**Intelligent Recipe Maker (IRM)** is a Python project designed to empower home cooks and culinary enthusiasts with a dynamic recipe creation and recommendation system. It leverages multiple approaches to cater to diverse preferences and dietary needs:

*   **Ingredient-Based Recommendation:** IRM can suggest delicious recipes based on the ingredients you have readily available in your pantry. Simply input your ingredients, and IRM will scan through its recipe database, suggesting suitable dishes that minimize ingredient waste.
*   **Dietary Restriction Support:** Whether you're vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, or following a specific diet, IRM allows you to filter recipes based on your dietary preferences. This ensures you discover recipes that align with your needs and health goals.
*   **Nutritional Information:** Access detailed nutritional information for each recommended recipe, including calories, macronutrients, and micronutrients. This empowers you to make informed decisions about your meals and maintain a balanced diet.
*   **Flavor Profile Customization:** Explore a range of flavor profiles, from spicy and savory to sweet and creamy. IRM can tailor suggestions to your preferred tastes, helping you discover exciting new culinary experiences.
